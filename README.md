# Minecraft-Manhunt

This Minecraft plugin is my version of the Manhunt plugin that appears in the YouTuber 
[Dream's](https://www.youtube.com/user/DreamTraps) videos. The plugin works on Minecraft 
version 1.16.2 and was built using the Spigot 1.16.2 API.

## Commands
- /addhunter \<username\>: sets the player with given username as a hunter, and adds a compass 
to the player's inventory (if the player is online and is not already a hunter)
- /removehunter \<username\>: removes the hunter role from the player with given username
- /gethunters: get a list of all current hunters' usernames

## Features

Hunters are automatically given a compass that allows them to track down victims. If you are a hunter,
right-click the compass to track the nearest player who is not a hunter.

## Installation Instructions

To add the plugin to your server, download the JAR file in the latest release and place it in your
server's plugins folder.
